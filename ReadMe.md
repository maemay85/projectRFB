Welcome to project RFB

This app will be the website of Reuben Fuller Bennet, Attorney at Law.
As a tenants rights lawyer, Reuben wants the site to serve as much as a resource for tenants as a business site.

MVP will include:
  - About page
  - Contact Form
  - Tenant Resources Section

Tier 2:
  - Add ability for Reuben to add "blog" content - either using a CRM or by creating a database
  - Pull in relevant data from Department of Buildings etc. through APIs for the Tenant Resource section


Collaboration:

- This project is a collaboration between myself (Mae) and Yael Krevsky, who will serve as the graphic designer and UI/UX consultant
